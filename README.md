## ðŸ§  Currently @ Hyground  
Iâ€™m a Founding Engineer at Hyground â€” an AI-powered platform that investigates alerts, identifies root causes, and proposes actionable solutions for IT operations teams.  
At Hyground, I design scalable backend and cloud systems, embed intelligent agents into production workflows, and translate high-level customer needs into implemented value.
